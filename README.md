# Semantic-Sentence-Similarity

This was the project for our course CS 760 (Machine Learning) during Fall '21 under Prof. Fred Sala.

You can find a detailed report with our experiments and results for the same [here](https://github.com/vikram71198/Sentence_Similarity/blob/main/Semantic_Similarity_using_Data_Augmentation_Report.pdf).

We've used the ICML '21 format to prepare this report.
